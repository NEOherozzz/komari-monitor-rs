# Komari Monitor Network Configuration Example
# This file can be used for hot-reloading configuration without restarting the program
# Specify the path to this file using --config-path argument

# Disable network statistics tracking (true/false)
disable_network_statistics=false

# Day of the month to reset traffic statistics (1-31)
# Traffic will be reset on this day each month
network_reset_day=1

# Interval in seconds between network traffic samples
network_interval=60

# Number of samples to accumulate in memory before writing to disk
# This reduces disk I/O. Actual write interval = network_interval * network_interval_number
network_interval_number=10

# Traffic calibration offsets in bytes
# These values are ADDED to the measured traffic to align with your VPS provider's statistics
# Use positive values if the provider shows more traffic, negative if less
# Example: If provider shows 1.5GB and program shows 1.4GB, set calibration to 107374182 (0.1GB)
network_calibration_tx=0
network_calibration_rx=0

# Example calibration scenarios:
# - Provider counts overhead, program doesn't: Use positive calibration
# - Need to account for pre-existing traffic: Use positive calibration
# - Program over-counts due to local traffic: Use negative calibration

# Note: You can modify calibration values in this file while the program is running
# The changes will be detected and applied automatically within one interval cycle
